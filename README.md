# SMS-Classifier
Develop a text classification model to classify SMS as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.
Creating an SMS classifier to classify spam and non-spam SMS involves using data science techniques, typically machine learning algorithms, to train a model on a dataset of labeled SMS messages. Python provides various libraries, such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NLTK, which can be utilized for this task. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how you can build an SMS classifier using Python:

Data Collection:

Obtain a dataset containing SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. You can find datasets for spam classification on platforms like Kaggle or other research repositories.
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Handle missing values, if any.
Convert the labels (spam or non-spam) into numerical format (e.g., 0 for non-spam, 1 for spam).
Text Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the text data. Common steps include:
Removing punctuation and special characters.
Converting all text to lowercase.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words.
Removing stop words (common words that don't contribute much to the classification task).
Lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their base or root form.
Feature Extraction:

Convert the processed text data into numerical features that machine learning models can understand.
Common methods include using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
Model Selection:

Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for classification. Common choices include:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Neural Networks
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training set using the features and labels.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):

Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for real-time or batch prediction on new, unseen SMS messages.
